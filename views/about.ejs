            Our platform enables users to volunteer and help nearby users in need of any emergency 
            assistance or aid. Through the website, users can send SOS request to other users in the 
            radius of 2km. Once the SOS request is sent, the nearby users receive the request and they 
            have the choice to either accept the request or reject it depending their personal situation.
            <br>
            Our app will be sending SOS messages not only to nearest police/medical stations, 
            assigned relatives but also to the local people who live near the victimâ€™s house. 
            All the people registered on the app will be verified with some kind of official 
            documentation (aadhaar card/PAN etc.). This verification is done to remove the possibility 
            of misuse of the application by some random person. All the requests made and requests 
            answered will be stored in a log. How sending messages to people living near the victims 
            house will help? Sending messages to the local people will be beneficial as they can offer 
            help much faster than police/ambulances. e.g. If someone crashed his car on highway, 
            locals can help promptly than police/ambulance.
